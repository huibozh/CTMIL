===

This repository contains core codes for our study "Customized Transformer for lymph node metastasis prediction from lung adenocarcinoma histology in a multicentric study". It includes training scripts for five different tumor patch detection models, code for extracting tumor patch features, training codes for CTMIL models, and scripts for computing attention scores and patch-level classification scores based on trained models. These scores are used to generate attention maps and patch-level classification maps for visual interpretation.
