Customized Transformer for lymph node metastasis prediction from lung adenocarcinoma histology in a multicentric study

This repository contains the core code for our study "Customized Transformer for lymph node metastasis prediction from lung adenocarcinoma histology in a multicentric study." It includes training scripts for five different tumor patch detection models, code for extracting tumor patch features, training code for CTMIL (Customized Transformer for Multiple Instance Learning) models, and scripts for computing attention scores and patch-level classification scores from trained models. These scores are used to generate attention maps and patch-level classification maps for visual interpretation.
